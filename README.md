Imagine tokens called “gomvit” being used by the students of our college for ride sharing. Tokens are generated whenever the app is being used. Miners also get these tokens as and when their blocks are added to the chain. This may seem very trivial or as a substitute for a normal app which has the information of the students willing to share their ride. But if this concept is extended to a mega city like Bangalore, validation and anonymity of the driver is necessary. Usage of such a service removes the necessity of a middleman like ola or uber (who charges exorbitant rates whenever the demand spikes).
